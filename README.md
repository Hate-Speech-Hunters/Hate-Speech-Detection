# Hate Speech Detection

This study is based on the domain of hate speech detection, and its primary aim is to perform a comparative study of different models. It utilizes a dataset of social media posts annotated for hate speech, and trains and evaluates various BERT models, like RoBERTa, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and ELECTRA.
The study compares the models based on metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. The results show that certain BERT models outperform others in hate speech detection, and the study discusses the architectural differences that produce varying results.
